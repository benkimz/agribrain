WHAT ARE THE COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS THAT YOU SEE FROM CONSUMERS ABOUT PRODUCE?,consumer preferences for sustainable agriculture,"People truly believe that farmers will do anything or use anything in their fields to produce a crop with no regard to the soil, surrounding environments or the end consumer. All of these things are the very lifeline that has sustained their families for generations.
The modern agri-business owner works hard to find the methods that are the most efficient, precise and have the least environmental impact in every decision they make, all the while complying with the strict regulatory standards set by numerous local, state and federal agencies.

WHAT DOES “ORGANIC PRODUCE” REALLY MEAN?,organic food market trends,"Organic farmers, ranchers, and food processors follow a defined set of standards to produce organic food and fiber. Congress described general organic principles in the Organic Foods Production Act, and the USDA defines specific organic standards. These standards cover the product from farm to table, including soil and water quality, pest control, livestock practices, and rules for food additives.

What this means is that organic growers do not have the same synthetically blended products for fighting disease and pest pressures that conventional growers have. Fertilizers must come from a natural source of nitrogen, such as fish emulsion, animal bone and shellfish meal, among others. They must also use preventative, rather than corrective, methods in controlling pests and disease pressures.","organic, produce",crop cultivation,curious to know more,False
WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO GROW ORGANICALLY?,organic food market trends,"Biological pesticides and predator-type pests are used, which is basically when a good pest (predator) essentially preys on a crop-damaging pest.

HOW HAS TECHNOLOGY CHANGED THE LIFE OF THE AMERICAN FARMER?,new technologies for improving market access,"We have seen a rise in the use of more precise equipment, such as real-time soil-moisture monitors. These probes read the moisture and nutrient content throughout various depths of the soil column in real time, and upload the readings via charts, graphs and data sheets to a dashboard.

This gives the grower the ability to better regulate the water and nutrients by keeping these crucial elements in the root zone, while preventing runoff to surrounding areas from over irrigating. Nutrients especially, can be money wasted when it’s driven below the root zone.

PRECISION AGRICULTURE—HOW DO YOU DEFINE WHAT IT IS?,sustainability trends in agriculture,"There is a lot of technology used to make modern agriculture more efficient. For example, GPS computer-guided tractors and harvesters, along with variable rate-fertilizer spreaders and chemical sprayers for more precise and efficient applications.

Other geo-referenced site-specific practices may include:

Soil sample collection and testing, along with soil mapping for the purpose of a more specialized and precise fertilizer application based off these results.
Aerial imagery comparing flight-to-flight rate of change, along with hot-spot analysis and crop-counting capabilities.
Crop-yield data collection with an overlay of historical soil and fertilizer maps, giving the grower the ability to create predictability models for future crops.
Each of these geo-referenced data layers also helps subdivide a large field area into smaller management zones. Using these smaller zones reduces waste while increasing production potential.

By studying these factors and using precision agriculture, farmers are able to produce more food on less land at a reduced cost.","precision, agriculture",crop cultivation,curious to know more,False
Where does our food come from?,global trends in agricultural trade,"People in developed countries such as the United States eat food that comes from all over the world. Such countries have the wealth to buy food products that are brought by plane or ship from far away. A wide variety of canned and packaged foods are available from every corner of the globe. And even fresh foods such as fruits, vegetables, fish, and meats can now be sped across oceans in refrigerated boats. So foods that were once rare treats are now available at nearly every time of the year, arriving from places with different climates and seasons. That means that the asparagus and strawberries you eat may be grown nearby—or halfway across the world! Today, when you look in your cupboards, it can be like taking a trip around the world: you will see tea from India, coffee from Brazil, olive oil from Italy, and much more. In the past, people ate only the food that they could produce on their farms or find at their local markets.",food,general questions,curious to know more,False
How has farming changed in the United States?,global trends in agricultural trade,"In the 1700s, English farmers settled in New England villages; Dutch, German, Swedish, Scotch-Irish, and English farmers settled on Middle Colony farmsteads; English and French farmers settled on plantations in tidewater and on isolated Southern Colony farmsteads in Piedmont; Spanish immigrants, mostly indentured servants, settled the Southwest and California. Farmers endured a rough pioneer life while adapting to their new environments, and by the 1800s small family farms grew and sold crops such as wheat, cotton, corn, and rice. But the work was hard and slow-going: in 1830, it took 250 to 300 hours of labor using very basic tools to produce 100 bushels (5 acres) of wheat. The growth of farming brought many laborsaving devices to 19th- and early 20th-century farm life, including reaping and threshing machines, which replaced work done by hand. Today, with modern methods of agriculture that include complex machinery, scientific breeding, and chemical pesticides, farms require far fewer workers.

Before the Industrial Revolution (which began in the 1800s in the United States), most people lived and worked on farms. In 1935, there were 6.8 million farms in the United States, and the average farmer produced enough food each year to feed about 20 people. By 2002, the number of farms had dropped to about 2.1 million, yet the average U.S. farmer produced enough food to feed almost 130 people. The average size of a farm in 1935 was smaller than it is today, about 155 acres (63 hectares) compared to about 467 acres (189 hectares) today.","farming, united states",general questions,curious to know more,False
Which U.S. states are the biggest farm states?,global trends in agricultural trade,"California produces the most agriculture (animal and plant foods) for the United States, contributing about two-thirds of the country’s fruits, nuts, berries, and melons. Almost one-quarter of the state’s land—about 27.7 million acres (11.2 million hectares)—is dedicated to farming. Other states that grow a large percent of the country’s food include Texas, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, and Arkansas. Texas, for example, produces the most cattle; Iowa raises the most hogs and grows the most corn; and North Dakota grows the most wheat. Arkansas is the state with the largest poultry production.","farm states, biggest, U.S",general questions,curious to know more,False
How does the combine harvester help farmers?,wheat,"The combine harvester saves the farmers time and labor. Before modern machinery, harvesting crops was a painstaking process. Gathering and removing mature plants from the field had to be done by hand. Farm workers used sharp-bladed, long-handled scythes and curved sickles to cut down cereal crops such as wheat. Even the fastest reaper could only clear about a third of an acre a day. Because rain could ruin harvested wheat, workers called sheaf-makers quickly tied it into bundles, so that it could be safely stored if the weather turned stormy. During the long winter months, farm workers used jointed wooden tools called flails to thresh or beat the dried wheat in order to separate its edible grain seeds from its stalks. But in 1786 a machine that threshed wheat by rubbing it between rollers was invented, replacing human threshers. And around 1840 a reaping machine—its revolving wheel pressed grain stalks against a sharp blade that cut them down—replaced human harvesters. Today, farm machines called combine harvesters do this work in much the same way. These machines, which are loaded with technology, are very efficient and combine all three jobs of cutting, collecting, and threshing a crop.",harvestor,crop cultivation,curious to know more,False
Who invented the earliest milking machines?,cattle (beef and dairy),"There are reports that primitive milking machines were used around 300 BCE by the ancient Egyptians, who used hollow wheat stems inserted in the teats to milk cows. But hand milking was popular in the United States until about the 1860s, when American inventors began finding more efficient ways to milk cows. In 1860, Lee Colvin invented the first hand-held pump device. In 1879, Anna Baldwin patented a milking machine that used a large rubber cup connected to the cow’s udder and to a pump lever and bucket. Working the pump lever pulled the milk out of the udder and into the bucket. Baldwin’s was one of the earliest American patents, but it was not successful. Her invention, like others of the time, created a continuous suction on the udder, damaging the cow’s fragile mammary tissue and causing the cow to kick. These ideas laid the groundwork for the successful milking machines that started to appear in later decades, and today’s highly automated milking machines use vacuum suction to gather milk.","milking machines, invented",livestock keeping,curious to know more,False
What is a seed drill?,new technologies for improving market access,"A seed drill was a device that allowed farmers to plant seeds in the soil and then cover them up. The instrument, created in 1701 by the English farmer Jethro Tull, allowed farmers to sow seeds in well-spaced rows at specific depths at a specific rate. Before this, farmers cast seeds to the ground in a haphazard fashion by hand, allowing them to grow where they landed (called “broadcasting”). The seed drill allowed farmers more control over their crops and less waste, and it was one of Tull’s several inventions, which included the horse-drawn hoe and an improved plough. Seed drills are still in use today, although they are much more sophisticated mechanisms.",seed drill,crop cultivation,curious to know more,False
What are windmills used for?,new technologies for improving market access,"Windmills, mechanisms that look like giant pinwheels, have been used to generate power and grind wheat since ancient times. American colonists used windmills to power machinery that could process what they grew on their farms, grinding wheat into flour and corn into cornmeal. Windmills also powered tools to saw wood and make typical household items, such as oil, paper, spices, chalk, and pottery. Through the 1920s, Americans used small windmills to generate electricity in rural areas. When power lines began to transport electricity to these areas in the 1930s, local windmills were used less and less. When the oil shortages of the 1970s created an interest in alternative energy sources, windmills became fashionable again, especially in states such as California whose governments encouraged renewable energy sources.

Today, clusters of giant windmills—more precisely called wind turbines, with blades reaching 200 feet (61 meters) long—sit atop windy hillsides in great numbers to make electricity. The force of the wind pushes the slanted blades, which causes them to rotate because they are bound by a shaft. This spinning shaft runs an electrical generator, which creates power. They are sometimes called wind power plants or wind farms. U.S. states with significant levels of wind production are California, Texas, Iowa, Minnesota, and Oklahoma.",windmills,general questions,curious to know more,False
What are barns used for?,new technologies for improving market access,"Today, the huge, airy farm structures we know as barns are used mostly to store modern farm machinery and house farm animals. But before modern farming, they had a greater number of important uses. Before the invention of threshing machines (which separate cereal grains such as wheat from their stalks), the grain harvest had to be stored in barns, where it would await threshing or pounding by hand during winter months. The structures had to be large and drafty for the process of winnowing, which separated straw dust from the grains after threshing.

Before farmers began to raise special crops to feed their livestock during the winter, they used hay, which is dried grass (grown wild or taken from the stalks of cereal crops). Huge amounts—enough to last several months—had to be stored away. Hay was usually kept in barn lofts located above the main floor, where farm animals spent the winter. This high storage place allowed air to circulate around the hay, keeping it from rotting. It was convenient, too, because hay could be pulled down as needed to feed the livestock.

Because farmers had to store their harvest crops in barns, they cut entrance holes near their roofs, inviting barn owls to make nests there. The birds would hunt the rats and mice that liked to feed on the grain.",barns,general questions,curious to know more,False
What is a silo?,cattle (beef and dairy),"The tall, cylinder-shaped farm structures known as silos are used to store silage, which is animal feed. Silage is moist feed made from green crops that ferment when stored in an airtight place. This fermentation process preserves the feed, which is used along with or instead of hay (dried grasses) to feed livestock (horses, cattle, sheep) during the winter when they cannot feed in green pastures. Silage gives farm animals needed nutrients. Before farmers started to raise food crops to feed their livestock (during the 18th century), they had to kill most of their animals when winter approached, because grass in pasturelands stopped growing and the animals faced starvation. But herds of livestock could be kept year-round once farmers began to grow crops for winter feed. Root crops like turnips, as well as leafy crops, were sometimes used. Today, corn is the crop most often used for silage.",silo,livestock keeping,curious to know more,False
Why are crops sprayed with pesticides?,crop damage prevention strategies,"Farmers and governments use chemical pesticides to protect crops from insect pests, weeds, and fungal diseases while they are growing. They also spray crops with pesticides to prevent rats, mice, and insects from contaminating foods while they are being stored. While these actions are meant to benefit human health and bring a wide variety of fruits and vegetables to the supermarket, they can also harm people, wildlife, and the environment. This is why there are strict controls in place over their sale and use.",pesticides,crop cultivation,curious to know more,False
What is organic farming?,organic food market trends,"While most large farms today use chemicals to control weeds and insects and to produce increased amounts of vegetables, milk, or eggs, some farmers have chosen to run their farms without chemicals. Organic farmers believe that the chemicals many farmers use can be damaging to the environment and to the people that eat the food grown on such farms. They feel that natural fertilizers and pest-control methods are just as effective and far healthier.

A British farmer and scientist named Albert Howard began the practice of organic farming as an alternative to modern chemical-based methods in the 1930s. His ideas have spread all over the world, taking hold in the United States in the late 1940s. A basic principle of organic farming is to focus on keeping the soil rich with nutrients by feeding it natural fertilizers such as cow manure. Such fertile soil can help create stronger plants that are better able to resist disease and insects. Organic farmers also prevent insect damage by putting up insect traps or by bringing in beneficial insects that feed on the harmful ones that are causing a problem. In extreme cases, they need to use pesticides, but to continue being certified as organic farmers in the United States, such farmers need to use botanical pesticides (those that are made from plants) rather than synthetic chemicals.",organic,crop cultivation,curious to know more,False
Does organic farming contribute to less pollution?,organic food market trends,"Yes. Organic farmers also try to do more tasks using human power rather than vehicles powered by fossil fuels, thereby using less fuel and cutting down on pollution. Organic farms that raise livestock such as dairy cows or chickens feed the animals with natural food, avoiding pollution-causing chemicals and growth hormones that make cows produce more milk and chickens produce more eggs. Some organic farmers also allow their animals to roam in a large area (such animals are described as “free range”) rather than keeping them in small, climate-controlled pens for their entire lives.","organic farming, pollution",crop cultivation,curious to know more,False
What is a fish farm?,fish (farmed),"Fish farms are businesses that produce a limited number of fish for sale in restaurants and supermarkets. The business is called aquaculture, which includes the farming of fish, shrimp, shellfish, and seaweed. Fish can be grown in natural waters—such as ponds, lakes, rivers, and streams—or artificial environments, including tanks, pools, and special cages. Fish species such as salmon, catfish, rainbow trout, tilapia, and cod are grown in fish farms. Fish farms around the world supply almost half of the world’s total food fish supply. The United States has fish farms in California, Idaho, Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and along the southeastern U.S. coast. However, it imports about 80 percent of its seafood—and half of these imports come from fish farms in Asia and Latin America.",fish farm,livestock keeping,know what,False
Can farm animals be cloned?,sheep,"Yes. In 1997 a team of scientists at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh, Scotland, announced the birth of Dolly the sheep, the first clone (identical copy) of an adult mammal. The process used to create Dolly, called somatic cell nuclear transfer, began with an egg cell from one sheep. The scientists destroyed that egg cell’s nucleus and then injected the nucleus from the cell of another sheep into the egg cell. With a little encouragement from electronic stimulation, the donated nucleus fused with the egg cell, and the new cell began to divide. The cluster of cells was then implanted into the uterus of the sheep that had provided the egg cell, and five months later Dolly was born—an exact replica not of the sheep that had carried her in the womb but of the sheep that had supplied the nucleus. While cloning mammals is controversial, some scientists argue that cloning farm animals has advantages to livestock farmers, who could use the technology to breed only high-quality animals that produce the most milk or the finest wool."," cloned, farm animals",livestock keeping,curious to know more,False
How can cows make so much milk?,cattle (beef and dairy),"A cow, like all mammals, produces milk to feed its young. If its calf nurses regularly, the mother cow’s mammary glands will produce enough milk to give the baby animal all the food it needs. Gradually a calf will nurse less as grass and other feed makes up more of its diet. A cow, in turn, will produce less milk until it is no longer needed.

But by milking the cows regularly—two or three times a day—dairy farmers can cause the cows to continue producing milk. Certain breeds of cows are particularly good at milk-making, producing 18 to 27 pints (around 2 to 3 gallons, or 10 to 15 liters) each day. A cow’s large, round udder, located on its underside, has four nipples, or teats, that are squeezed to release stored milk. While once done by hand, milking is done on modern dairy farms by machines with suction hoses, which do the job more quickly and cheaply. Trucks collect milk from farms and take it to processing plants where it is pasteurized (made germ-free) and used to make dairy products such as cheese, butter, and ice cream."," cows, milk",livestock keeping,know how,True
Why do cows stand around in fields eating all day?,cattle (beef and dairy),"In order to produce four or more gallons of milk each day, dairy cows have to eat a lot. Producing milk requires additional calories in the form of extra food. A large dairy cow may eat up to 150 pounds (about 68 kilograms) of grass each day, and that takes time.

Cows have special stomachs, too, that make eating a slow process. Instead of having one chamber like a human’s, a cow’s stomach has four chambers. When a cow takes a bite of grass it swallows it right away without chewing it. The food goes into the first chamber of its stomach, called the rumen (animals that have such stomachs are called ruminants), where it mixes with fluid to form a soft mass. The mushy grass is regurgitated or brought back up again later, when the cow is resting. This “cud” is thoroughly chewed, swallowed, and digested as it passes through all the other chambers of the stomach. A cow spends nearly nine hours each day chewing its cud. Scientists think that when animals like cows lived in the wild they had to snatch grass in a hurry before predators attacked them. Their special stomachs allowed them to store food for later chewing and digestion once they were hidden and out of danger. Goats, sheep, camels, and antelope are other examples of ruminants."," cows, milk",livestock keeping,know why,False
Why do horses sleep standing up?,horse,"Horses, which are often found on farms, sleep standing up for a number of reasons. Their legs can lock in place, enabling them to fall asleep without falling over. Because they are prey animals, horses often do not feel comfortable sleeping on the ground, and most of their sleeping is done during the day rather than at night when predators are out hunting. Horses have straight backs, so they cannot get up quickly. If a predator were to come while a horse was on the ground, it might not be able to get up fast enough to escape. However, horses do occasionally take short naps lying down during the day, which helps them rest their legs. When horses are in groups, they will often take turns guarding each other as they rest, with one horse standing up near the sleeping horse."," horses, sleep",livestock keeping,know why,False
Why are pigs so dirty?,pig,"Because pigs will eat almost anything, they have traditionally been fed farm leftovers and waste. This unappealing diet—commonly known as slop—may contain food waste from a farm household or the unusable by-products of the manufacturing processes for butter, cheese, and even beer brewing. Pigs are natural foragers, frequently using their snouts to dig up roots or grubs for food when they are in the wild. On farms they are fed from low troughs, but their big snouts and foraging habits still make them very messy eaters. Adding to the dirty reputation of pigs is the fact that they are usually kept in pens, or sties, close to farm buildings to make their feeding quick and easy. They—and their messes—have been confined to small spaces, unlike cows and sheep, which are traditionally free to roam pastureland. Because pigs are raised mainly for their meat and fat, they are given a lot of food and spend most of their time eating. Piglets that weigh only a few pounds at birth can reach more than 200 pounds (90 kilograms) in less than half a year.",pigs,livestock keeping,know why,False
How Much Caffeine in Tea?,tea,"So-called “real” Tea (in other words, NOT Herbal or Fruit Tisanes) comes from the Camellia sinensis plant. This is but one of around 60 plants to naturally contain caffeine, with others including Coffee (Coffea), Cocoa (Theobroma cacao) and Yerba Mate (Ilex paraguariensis). 

However, depending on the specific brew you choose, there will be varying caffeine levels in tea. This is because of its processing, which alters the chemical makeup of the leaves.

White Tea, the least processed variety, has about 15-mg per 8-oz cup. Next, there is Green Tea with 30-mg. Oolong Tea, on the other hand, contains approximately 35-37-mg, while Black Tea boasts 40-mg.","tea, caffeine",consumer questions,curious to know more,False
Does Green Tea Have Caffeine?,tea,"Yes. As mentioned previously, Green Tea Caffeine does, indeed, exist. Yet the level is less than that of, say, Black Tea. The reason for this is its processing.

Once harvested, the leaves arrive at the factory, at which point they undergo “pan-firing” or steaming to prevent too much oxidation. By stopping oxidation, green tea maintains much of its natural profile - which lacks significant amounts of caffeine.

Indeed, the more workers do to the Tea leaves, the more likely they will contain caffeine. And the more caffeine they contain, the more they will provide you with that early-morning energy boost.

Nevertheless, it is additions such as milk and sugar that contribute most to calorie intake in your morning cuppa. With semi-skimmed, you’re looking at around 13 calories. Whole milk, on the other hand, has about 19 calories.

Does Tea Have More Caffeine Than Coffee?,tea,"This is where things start to get REALLY interesting. Because, contrary to belief, the amount of Caffeine in Coffee, specifically in dry form, is less than that in an equal weight of Tea.

Technically, this then means that, before brewing, there is more Caffeine in Tea than that in Coffee. Are you a little confused? Then please allow us to explain.

Basically, you can get more cuppas from a unit quantity of Tea leaves than from an equal quantity of Coffee. This results in the caffeine content in Tea “spreading out”, all the while the caffeine in Coffee remains more concentrated.

Can Dogs Drink Tea?,tea,"Now and again, we love to treat our pets to scraps under the table. Whether it’s the fat from a bacon rasher or surplus gravy, the occasional leftover rarely does any harm to our furry friends. But Is it safe for dogs to drink tea? 

Technically, yes - in small quantities. However, it hopefully goes without saying that your brew shouldn’t be hot. What’s more, and perhaps more importantly, the Caffeine in Tea could pose a risk to dogs if they drink too much. This is because caffeine elevates the heart rate, as well as having the potential to be toxic.

Is Tea a Diuretic?,tea,"Again, it depends on the type. But let’s first start at the beginning. The term “Diuretic” refers to promoting the formation of urine, which, in essence, enables someone to excrete excess water.

It sounds a little odd, but there are, indeed, benefits to it. People with high blood pressure, heart failure, swollen tissues and kidney disease often use diuretics as a treatment.

The four primary types of Tea (Black, Green, White and Oolong) can help. However, it’s worth noting that there are better options, namely Milk Thistle Tea and Dandelion Root Tea.

Both of these varieties, according to the latest scientific research, have extraordinary diuretic properties. Other choices include Nettle, Camomile, Peppermint, Ginger and Fennel Tea.","tea, diuretic",consumer questions,clear a doubt,False

What is High Tea?,tea,"We’ve all heard of Afternoon Tea - a quintessentially English pastime associated with ornate Teacups, delectable finger sandwiches and scrumptious miniature cakes. But what, then, is High Tea? And why have so few people today heard about it?

Enjoying a High Tea refers more to a social event than a specific type of Tea. It first became popular as an affordable option of the British working classes during the 18th and 19th centuries. During this period, it often consisted of “heavier” foods such as meat pies and boiled potatoes.

All of this, of course, was washed down by a strong cup of what we today might call Builder’s Tea. 

Rather than being a frivolous pastime like Afternoon Tea, a High Tea was a necessity. The upper classes indulged to avoid feeling peckish while simultaneously enjoying the company of friends.
A High Tea, in comparison, needed to feed the family. As such, you’re unlikely to see it on the menu when searching for an Afternoon Tea venue. Nevertheless, it has much to offer.",high tea,consumer questions,curious to know more,False
Where Does Tea Come From?,tea,"There are two answers to this question, depending on the context. If you’re referring to its botanical origins, the answer is simple: Tea comes from the Camellia sinensis plant.

If, however, you’re talking about where in the world Tea grows, it becomes a little broader. 

China is arguably the home of Tea, although it has since spread to other countries across the globe. Indeed, Tea production takes place in Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Thailand, Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi.

Does Green Tea Stain Teeth?,tea,"It can, yes. The primary reason for this is the Tannins in Tea. These are a class of astringent polyphenols that can, admittedly, contribute to teeth stains.

With Green Tea, in particular, it might leave behind a dull grey mark, while Black Tea creates a yellowish discolouration. But it’s not all bad news. Indeed, Tannins in Tea likewise have a part to play in Green Tea benefits.

Research has shown that tannins have antioxidant activity, meaning the pros far outweigh the cons. With Green Tea, an abundance in tannins called catechins, specifically Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), translates to improved cardiovascular health and reduced diabetes risks."," green tea, stain teeth",consumer questions,curious to know more,False
Is Black Tea Good for You?,tea,"EGCG in Green Tea is, perhaps, the most health-beneficial antioxidant of them all. Black Tea, meanwhile, contains theaflavin and thearubigin.

Evidence exists in a study conducted by the University of Singapore and published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. The project saw some 2,500 participants aged 55 or over undergo cognitive measuring. Two years later, scientists remeasured those involved.

The results established that participants who drank two or three cups of Black Tea a day had a 55% lower chance of suffering from cognitive decline. Those who drank six to ten cups a day, meanwhile, had up to a 63% lower chance.

What we’re trying to say is that there is no such thing as a 100% decaffeinated Tea or Coffee.

Depending on the efficiency of the decaffeination process, however, Tea can have about 94-98% of the caffeine removed. Indeed, the best options will have no more than 5-10 milligrams remaining.

But that’s another story (and another blog!). Let’s instead look into aspects of Tea production that WERE invented over the course of history: 

Production methods for making Black Tea invented in the Chinese Qing dynasty (1644-1912).

Afternoon Tea invented by Anna, the seventh Duchess of Bedford, in 1840.

Breakfast Tea (likely) invented by Robert Drysdale in 1892.

British colonists, angered by “taxation without representation” (especially taxes on Tea), decided to stage a protest. Dressing up as Native Americans, they boarded ships in the Boston Harbor and dumped 342 chests of Tea into the water below.

Can You Drink Tea When Pregnant?,tea,"Yes - in moderation. It’s essential to note, however, that the primary concern of drinking Tea during pregnancy is its caffeine content.

NHS Choices recommends that pregnant women limit their intake to 200-mg of caffeine per day - the equivalent of two cups of fresh Coffee. Yet providing you monitor how much Tea you drink, it is, for the most, safe.

Another option, of course, is caffeine-free Herbal Tea. Again, though, bear in mind that some of these infusions come with side effects of their own.

One recommended by some midwives is Raspberry Leaf Tea (NO SOONER THAN the third trimester), which, according to research, comes with pregnancy benefits. Just be sure to speak with a medical professional before brewing it up.","tea, pregnant",consumer questions,curious to know more,False

How is Tea Decaffeinated?,tea,"The process of decaffeination, first invented by Ludwig Roselius, dates back to 1903. He began by using benzene, a potentially toxic hydrocarbon, to extract caffeine molecules from pre-moistened Green Coffee Beans.

Methods have, thankfully, moved on since then. Here at The Kent and Sussex Tea and Coffee Company, we utilise two of the safest and most efficient techniques to decaffeinate our products.

The first is the CO2 process, which uses pressurised liquid carbon dioxide to extract the stimulating molecules. This ultimately removes between 96% and 98% of the caffeine from Tea or Coffee.

The Swiss water process, meanwhile, involves hot water passing through beans - taking the caffeine and flavour molecules with it. The taste is then returned using a carbon filter, while 96% of caffeine is removed.","tea, decaffeinated",consumer questions,curious to know more,False

Yet it’s important to note the term “somewhere”. This is because seldom do two Oolong Tea shares the same oxidation levels. Some types undergo 8% oxidation while others can be oxidised up to 80%.

Less oxidation means its taste likely resembles Green Tea, while more oxidation almost certainly makes it akin to Black Tea. Whatever you choose, expect a truly unique brew.",oolong tea,consumer questions,curious to know more,False
Why tannins of Tea do not precipitate and neutralize the caffine and other alkaloids?,tea,"Interesting question. I've seen caffeine/theobromine co-precipitate with cacao procyanidins in organic solvents (e.g., ACN, MeOH). May play somewhat differently in water. Phenomenon likely due to larger degrees of polymerization (DP) in cacao relative to tea. One needs a fairly high concentration of dimeric or trimeric tannin to precipitate BSA. Once you exceed <3DP, it will precipitate BSA quite readily. The proline residues responsible for tannin binding/precipitation are structurally similar to caffeine.

How does entrepreneurial resilience affect or impact our farm entrepreneurs in the community?,entrepreneurial,"Entrepreneurial resilience can also play a role in the ability of farm entrepreneurs to access resources and support. Resilient entrepreneurs may be more likely to seek out and take advantage of available resources, such as financial assistance or mentorship programs. They may also be more likely to build a support network of other entrepreneurs and industry professionals, which can provide valuable advice and assistance in navigating challenges.
In addition to its effects on individual farm entrepreneurs, entrepreneurial resilience can also have a positive impact on the overall agricultural industry. A more resilient agricultural sector is better able to adapt to changes in markets and consumer demands, and can be more responsive to emerging trends and innovations. This can lead to increased productivity, efficiency, and competitiveness, which can benefit farmers, agribusinesses, and the broader community.
Entrepreneurial resilience is a crucial quality for farm entrepreneurs as they often face many challenges such as weather-related crop losses, fluctuations in crop prices, and difficulty accessing markets.

What role has agribusiness played in international trade?,agribusinesses,"Agribusiness is a generic term that refers to the various businesses involved in food production, including farming, seed supply, agrichemicals, farm machinery, wholesale and distribution, processing, marketing and retail sales. It encompasses broad marketing techniques wherein international comparative advantage is harnessed to the best potential by globally sourcing commodities.

These activities are carried out by select firms/corporations that are in business because of their strong capital base and transnational presence. Global corporations now control about one-third of the world's productive assets and three-quarters of world trade. Their control has been facilitated by the process of globalisation, which entails the free flow of goods, services, capital and knowledge among nations. The spread of global trade, deregulation of capital markets, and technology that facilitates global communication and transportation all have driven changes in global trade and investment rules. These changes have, in turn, supported the expansion of new global commodity chains and the growth of agribusiness.

Agribusiness activities have introduced new managerial techniques and facilitated the integration of domestic markets with international markets, thereby providing abundant opportunities to farmers and trading partner countries to supplement shortages in food and other agricultural commodities.

There are reports of malpractice by agribusiness firms trying to manipulate the demand-supply situation to their benefit. Some agribusiness firms, on account of their capital position and influence, have been instrumental in the formulation of trade rules and procedures at various multilateral forums. Food and agricultural products have a very short shelf-life, making their processing, post-harvest treatment and assured market options a necessity. Through their scale of operations, agribusiness firms possess the capacity to turn the weaknesses and strengths in trade agreements and flows to their benefit.","Agribusinesses, international trade",general questions,know what,False

"What are the distortionary influences of transnational and multinational agribusiness firms in international corporations, in agriculture?",agribusinesses,"Trade liberalisation and global inter-connectedness pose new opportunities as well as challenges for countries. With more than 900 million people on earth still experiencing starvation, it is obvious that our current global food and agriculture system is lacking somewhere. The root of the problem is that large and influential corporate houses, whose main motive is generating profits and not feeding people, run the current agriculture system.

Over the past decades, fewer and fewer firms have been controlling more and more of the global food market. Three or four firms control most of the international trade of each product, both on the export and import sides.

The agriculture market today is characterised by both horizontal as well as vertical concentrations. Both concentrations give these firms a lot of power to influence prices -- both paid to producers as well as charged from consumers. Vertical integration helps firms control not just one aspect of food production but the entire process. This entails not just selling seeds, fertiliser and pesticides but also the purchase of crops from producers, their processing, and onward sale to retailers.
Other problems with consolidation in the agribusiness industry include:

Loss of bargaining power: Farmers are inherently disadvantaged in the market due to their large numbers compared with fewer processors. They therefore lose out on price. Concentrated market is an important reason for the erosion of farm income. Agribusiness pulls profits of farmers downstream and increases the profits of agribusiness firms.
Farmers lose flexibility in enterprise choice. Bound to a crop or livestock enterprise by a contract, farmers cannot adjust their production mix so as to benefit from opportunities; hence there is loss of income for family farms.
Agriculture dumping: Agriculture dumping is a process in which one agricultural company in a country exports its product to another country at a price lower than the cost of production. This is done so that they are able to drive down prices to be paid to farmers.
Agriculture dumping creates an unfair trading advantage for exporting agribusiness firms by depressing international prices and narrowing or even eliminating market opportunities for producers in other countries.
Increase of corporate influence over public policy: These firms have an incredible amount of influence over agricultural policy decisions. They wield considerable power at the WTO. It was former Cargill vice-president, Dan Amstutz, who drafted the original Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) text when he was a member of the US trade representative's office. Amstutz was also appointed by the Bush administration as the President's senior adviser on agriculture, in post-invasion Iraq .
Environment erosion: There is a lot of soil and water contamination due to increased dependence on pesticides and other chemicals, soil erosion due to production of only one crop, and loss of biodiversity.","influences , transnational, multinational, agribusiness firms, international corporations, agriculture?",general questions,know what,False
"What is market concentration, and how does it affect trade and economy?",trade and economy,"Market concentration is related to the concept of industrial concentration, which concerns the distribution of production within an industry by a few select companies. Market concentration also indicates lack of competition, wherein a few firms set the price and many firms are not in a position to enter or operate in a fair manner. In economics, the concentration ratio (CR) can be estimated as the market share of the four largest firms in the industry. A CR 4 of 40% or less is generally considered to be a competitive market. In 2005, CR 3 for Australian supermarkets was 89%; the CR 3 for soy oil refining in Brazil was 86%, and CR 4 for most agricultural commodity processing in the US ranges between 50% and 83% (Heffernan W, Hendrickson M, and Gronski R, 2002).

Market power gives agribusiness firms power to affect prices and reduce competition that is essential for a sector of economic activity to determine and lay down standards. Firms wielding immense market power squeeze farmers from both sides. The market power of retailers, processors, railways, and grain companies that dominate the downstream side of the agri-food chain allow them to take large and increasing portions of the consumer's grocery store, and hence profits. These firms reach the food system revenue stream and extract very high returns. As their power increases, less money makes it back to the farm level.

Market concentration also affects consumers in a number of ways, mostly by dictating government regulatory policy, flouting pesticide residue norms in soft drinks and food items, and driving out the supply of important commodities from different regions. The firms encourage farmers to over-produce, resulting in low prices, often below the cost of production. This causes a price squeeze which means that the input cost for farmers rises but the output price falls. In developed countries like the US , the net farm income of farmers has fallen substantially since 1996, despite a near tripling in government subsidies. Therefore, market power increases the processor's profits by widening the margin between the farm and wholesale or retail price level.","market concentration, trade, economy",general questions,know what,False
"What has been the role of agribusiness in developing countries, and how do they fit in their agricultural production processes and development?",agribusinesses,"Developing countries have been witnessing changes in lifestyle and spending. With increased urbanisation there is increased dependence of food retailers and manufacturers on specialised procurement channels and dedicated wholesalers have set new standards for food quality and safety.

Food is now directly sold to formal sector retail outlets such as supermarkets, rather than grown for sale at local markets. Private sector participation in developing countries is being intensively promoted to allow accelerated technology transfer, capital inflow and an assured market for crop production.

Changes in agri-food systems have significant implications for growth, poverty and food security. On the positive side, agribusiness is responding to strong consumer demand for high-value commodities, processed products and pre-prepared foods. At the same time, expanding markets offer farmers opportunities for new value-addition, compared with primary production, while exporters and agro-processing enterprises furnish crucial inputs and services to the farm sector.

However, on the negative side, rapid development could displace small farmers, processors, stores and traders who depend on traditional marketing and distribution channels at a pace that does not allow them enough time to create alternative opportunities. Small-scale farmers, who are faced with increasingly strict agro-industry standards, face all the risks. So also small-scale traders, processors, wholesale markets and retailers who are forced to compete with large goods suppliers and manufacturers. Less intervention by the State and increased concentration of corporate entities diminishes competition and the fair market framework for trade in agriculture.","role, agribusiness, developing countries",general questions,know what,False

"What are the challenges thrown up by the growing influence of these agribusiness firms, and how can their monopoly and unfair practices be regulated?",agribusinesses,"Global corporations now control one-third of the world's productive assets and three-quarters of all world trade. Agribusiness firms have matured steadily over the last several decades, with the result that small processors and small agricultural producers have become a shrinking part of the landscape. The increased consolidation of agribusiness firms in the food industry has led to a more imperfect market.

Farmers are at a disadvantage because they are numerous, while processors are few. They turn up as price-takers with invariably no bargaining power. Firms wielding immense market power squeeze farmers from both sides. The market power of retailers, processors and grain companies dominates the agri-food chain and takes a larger and increasing portion of the producer's surplus, making windfall gains. They win both ways -- when prices fall as well as when they peak. On the other hand, farmers always bear the brunt, losing out during times of bumper production as well as low yields. The following methods could be used to regulate the unfair practices of agribusiness firms:

Introduce fairness in trade: All transactions should be done in a fair and transparent manner wherein farmers are made aware of the prevailing market price and receive a fair margin of the market share.
Strengthen cooperatives: Most developing countries have a large number of small farms and a collective mechanism of marketing and delivery of input through the cooperative movement. This goes a long way in providing a congenial atmosphere and mitigating the risks of marketing.
Public scrutiny of mergers and acquisitions (M&As): Most cartels exist on account of lack of effective regulation mechanisms and a review of competition policies. Stronger regulation and civil society participation in the review of M&As between companies could reduce imperfections in the market.
Strict auditing of food and trade flows: On account of lopsided trade rules and a restriction of State intervention in the marketplace, the role of transnational and multinational corporations is set to increase in the production and trade of food articles in developing countries. To regulate speculation, cartelisation and malpractice, strict auditing of food balances and trade flows needs to be carried out. Only such strong action will help check speculation as well as exploitation of natural resources."," challenges, agribusiness firms, monopoly, unfair practices, regulated",general questions,know what,False

Tips On Starting An Agri Business:,african clawed frog,"The first thing about starting an agriculture business is deciding what you want to produce. Remember, the profits you make depend on the market value of the commodity you choose. The climate, soil, irrigation, fodder and other inputs in your area should suit this commodity.

Next, you will need cash to buy seeds, pesticides, land, fertilizer, machinery and other inputs. The government offers a variety of Kisan Credit Cards and financial schemes to help you out with finance. View list of various agricultural loans offered.

Hiring farmers and other staff can make the job of farming a lot easier.

. After, harvesting begins the process of marketing and distribution. Store your produce carefully and deal with marketing cooperatives and other agencies for good remuneration.

"When should I plant my avocado tree? How big a hole should I dig? Should I put some gravel, crushed rock or planting mix at the bottom of the hole? I have a heavy clay soil. Should I elevate the tree in a mound for better drainage? What do you mean by a ""coarse yard mulch"" and where can I get some? How much sun is best for my tree? Full sun, morning, afternoon?",avocados,"Avocado trees like warm ground. Ideally, they should go into the ground from March through June. If they go in during the summer there is always the risk of sun damage because the trees can't take up water very well when young.

How big a hole should I dig?
As deep as the current root ball and just as wide as the width plus a little extra so you can get your hands into the hole to plant it. Don't drop the tree into the hole, the roots don't like that, ease it into the hole. The avocado root system is very sensitive and great care should be taken not to disturb the root system when transplanting. If the tree is root bound, however, loosen up the soil around the edges and clip the roots that are going in circles.

Should I put some gravel, crushed rock or planting mix at the bottom of the hole?
No. Do not put gravel or anything else like planting media in the hole. The sooner the roots get out into the bulk soil, the better the tree will do. Planting mix creates a textural difference between the root ball and the bulk soil and causes water movement problems. Remember, there are 5 million acres of tree crops in California planted without planting mix.

I have a heavy clay soil. Should I elevate the tree in a mound for better drainage?
Yes, good idea. Make the mound 1 to 2 feet high and 3 to 5 feet around. Put down 20 pounds of gypsum spread around the base of the tree and mulch the area with 6 inches of woody mulch keeping the material about 6-8 inches away from the tree trunk.

What do you mean by a ""coarse yard mulch"" and where can I get some?
Redwood bark will work and maybe cocoa bean husks and shrededed tree bark. Need something that is woody and about 2 inches in diameter. Coarse yard mulch is available at some garden supply centers. Be sure it is COARSE, not fine, yard mulch - and disease-free to prevent introducing diseases to your tree (like root rot). Another source of coarse mulch would be a tree trimming operation, like Asplundh or Davy. They usually have material that has been pruned from the tops of trees and doesn't contain any diseased roots. Just go through the yellow pages looking for tree services.

How many different kinds of avocados in the world?,avocados,"Keep in mind that each seed planted results in an avocado tree very different from the parent tree. For example, you plant a seed from a Hass avocado... the seed is the result of cross-pollination and the resulting tree and fruit will be very different from its parents. Since this is the process by which new varieties are discovered, there are literally thousands of named varieties of avocados (and untold unnamed ones in the wild). In fact, there is a lady who has volunteered to go back through the literature and compile a list of named varieties for us, so far she has over 1000 varieties in her database! However, there are really only a small number of commercial varieties being grown for sale today, the main one being Hass.","kinds, avocados, world",crop cultivation,curious to know more,False
How can I tell when my avocados are ripe?,avocados,"Avocados do not ""ripen"" on the tree, that is, they do not get soft while on the tree. Once you pick an avocado, it takes about 7 to 10 days for it to soften when left at room temperature. You can speed the process up slightly by placing the avocado in a bag with some other ripe fruit (like an apple) or slow the process down by keeping the fruit in the refrigerator.

As far as knowing when it is ready to be picked, it is hard to tell from the outside when an avocado is mature. What the industry does is called a ""dry weight"" test which gives you an indirect measure of the oil content of the fruit. If the oil content is too low, the fruit is not ripe yet and will shrivel or stay rubbery insted of getting soft. I suggest you pick a couple of fruit and try to ripen them. If the fruit shrivel up or seem rubbery insted of soft, they are not mature yet. Keep picking fruit every few weeks. Note on the calendar when they soften insted of turning rubbery. Also, note the taste of the fruit. The oil content of the fruit usually increases through the season and there will be a certain point when it tastes ""just right."" That date will usually vary somewhat due to climate conditions... and some years will be better than others. Some varieties can also reach a point where they have too much oil and some will turn rancid (although many types fall from the tree before reaching that point).

The Hass avocado typically ripens in February and is good through June or July. These dates depend a lot on where you live and climate conditions. Some years you can pick larger fruit as early as December and they will ripen up. Up in Ventura County, fruit can remain on the tree and still be good into August and September.

I just planted an avocado tree. How long before I start getting fruit?,avocados,"This depends on several factors. First of all, are you purchasing a tree from a nursery or growing a tree from seed? If purchasing a tree, you can probably expect to see your first fruit 3-4 years after planting the tree. If growing from seed, it can take anywhere from 5 to 13 years before the tree is mature enough to set fruit.

"Which is better for health, tea or coffee??",drinks & beverages,"both coffee and tea have health benefits. Providing you don't load your coffee – or tea – with sugar and cream, either can be a good source of certain nutrients and antioxidants linked to disease prevention.
Let's start with tea. Fresh tea leaves are an incredibly rich source of phytochemicals called catechins, which have potent antioxidant properties. In fact, tea is one of the highest sources of antioxidants in the North American diet. When it comes to health, most of the research has focused on green tea suggesting the beverage may help lower the risk of certain cancers (breast, ovarian) and heart disease. Regular black tea drinkers have also been found to have a lower risk of developing heart disease.
The strongest evidence for coffee's health benefits centre around diabetes. Drinking coffee – at least three cups per day – has been linked to a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes in a number of studies. Coffee – caffeinated and decaffeinated – contains an antioxidant called chlorogenic acid, which has been shown to dampen inflammation in the body, reduce glucose (sugar) absorption and improve how the body uses insulin, the hormone that lowers blood glucose. Coffee also contains magnesium, a mineral linked to blood sugar regulation.
There is a downside with coffee for some people: its high caffeine content. (Tea contains much less caffeine than coffee.) Drinking too much coffee can result in a high intake of caffeine which can disrupt sleep and rob calcium from bones (if you consume too little calcium from foods). And some studies suggest that high intakes of caffeine during pregnancy can increase the risk of miscarriage.
Women of childbearing age should limit caffeine intake to 300 milligrams per day. Other healthy adults can safely consume 400 milligrams daily – almost 2.5 cups of coffee worth. (One eight ounce cup of regular coffee (filter drip) contains roughly 180 milligrams of caffeine.) One eight ounce cup of black tea has 43 milligrams of caffeine and green tea contains 30 milligrams.
Coffee – both regular a decaf – can also trigger heartburn if you have reflux (GERD).
So what's better for you – coffee or tea? That really depends on you. If you are not sensitive to caffeine and don't suffer heartburn, both coffee and tea are considered healthy especially if you skip the sugar.
If it's antioxidants you're after, go for green tea which contains about three times more catechins than black tea.","better for health, tea or coffee",general questions,know what,False

I want to grow avocados in a greenhouse. What variety would you suggest?,avocados,"First of all, be aware that you will have to prune your tree to keep it small enough for your greenhouse. I have seen a tree in Chile that was at least 60 feet tall. But don't worry - I think for your purposes you can keep them pruned to around 12 - 15 feet. You will probably need to prune the tree several times a year but the major topping should be done in the winter time.
Now, as to variety or kind to grow - there are 100's of avocado varieties for you to consider. Given the fact that you want to grow this in a greenhouse you might want to go with a less vigorous variety. The 'Gwen' avocado is a green skin variety that produces a smaller tree. I have seen 12 year old trees that are about 15' tall without pruning. The tree is semi-compact with an average width of approx 10 feet. The fruit in California matures around March and will hang on the tree to approx May/June. Another variety which produces summer fruit is the 'Reed' which is also a green-skin variety. This is a vary upright colummar tree with a smaller average width. I have seen these trees successfully maintained at below 15 feet. The fruit of this variety in my opinion is excellent, especially in late summer (approx 16 - 18 months after flowering). You could also consider the 'Pinkerton' (green skin, early season fruit) which tends more to be a spreading shorter tree. The 'Hass' (the variety that turns black when ripe) is a moderately vigorous spreading tree. A new variety is the 'Lamb Hass' which is also an upright tree. It produces fruit that also turns black when ripe. The fruit matures late spring through the summer.","avocados, greenhouse, variety",crop cultivation,curious to know more,False

Recent research data shows that infiltration of water in CA systems is greater than in conventionally tilled plots as long as ZT is combined with residue cover.Farmers may choose to apply either chemical or organic fertilizers to meet crop requirements, though decomposing crop residues from green manure cover crops (GMCCs), other cover crops and previous crops also supply essential nutrients. One important distinction between CA and other agricultural systems is that crop residues are left on the soil surface and are not incorporated into the soil. Chemical and organic fertilizers, however, should be banded into the soil with minimal soil disturbance using the appropriate planting equipment. The result of improved biological activity in CA soils means more nutrient recycling and a better nutrient supplying capacity of the soil. However, for high yield, some additional external nutrients may need to be applied. It may be difficult to band bulky organic fertilizers and these can be placed as a mulch on the soil surface where microbes utilize and break them down in forms available to plant roots.","CA, nutrient supplies, cropping systems",general questions,get insights,False
Is it true that farmers typically must wait 4-5 years until agricultural yields reach those attained under successful conventional agricultural systems?,conservation agriculture,"Though some farmers have reported lower yields during early stages of adoption of CA, many others have reported comparable or increased agricultural yields during this same period. Early success under CA has as much to do with agroecological conditions as with farmer experience and knowledge in land management. No-till farmers in South Asia have experienced early success and higher yields with ZT wheat due to their ability to plant their crops closer to their optimal planting dates since they no longer use valuable planting time for tillage operations. In other cases, the condition of the soil must be significantly improved before agricultural yields can be maintained or improved. For example, heavily compacted soils low in soil organic matter (SOM) content require a longer transition phase than healthier soils with higher levels of SOM. Such problems can be remedied by growing cover crops and incorporating organic amendments into the soil even before converting to a strict no-till (NT) system. During this ""transition phase,"" farmers must carefully monitor changes in soil quality and effectively manage pest and weed problems. If all this is done properly and according to the specific on-farm conditions and management desires of the farmer, agricultural yields will likely be maintained or increased under CA, as compared to conventional production systems. It may take several years for the soil to visibly show improved properties and health.","agricultural yields, conventional agricultural systems",general questions,get insights,False
What are the recommended first steps one should take when considering a transition to conservation agriculture?,conservation agriculture,"One should first try to obtain information on CA practices and principles from available and reliable sources, including friends and family members, local extension personnel, other farmers who have used CA or books and publications in libraries and on the internet. Farmers should also identify possible sources of seeds for locally adapted cover crop species as well as the necessary tools and equipment for implementing NT systems. It is recommended that farmers start small, by partitioning off a small experimental plot having few agricultural limitations. Farmers are encouraged to be active learners in the process of establishing no-till conservation agriculture on their own farms, and over time and with careful observation and management practices, they may successfully adapt the new technologies to their own farming conditions. Try to find a farmer in your area who is already practicing CA and learn from him what is important for it to be successful.

Are there increased pest and weed problems under CA?,conservation agriculture,"Enhanced weed and pest problems during the ""transition phase"" to CA is a major problem for many farmers and a significant obstacle to widespread farmer adoption. But this is also a major factor for farmers transitioning to organic agriculture. Weed and pest problems are biological symptoms of the change in ecosystem management under CA. Whereas farmers under conventional agriculture rely on tillage operations to help control many weeds and soil pathogens, farmers under CA must rely on alternative measures for weed and pest control. Some farmers respond by increasing applications of chemical herbicides, fungicides and pesticides. Others prefer to use organically based products. Regardless of one's product preference, integrated weed and pest management are necessary components of a successful CA system. Crop rotations and enhanced biodiversity are two mechanisms that help control weed and pest problems under CA. Thus, farmers typically report reduced levels of weed and pest problems under CA after a period of 4-5 years, or the time it takes for the system to achieve a new biological balance. This results in an overall decline in rates of application of agrochemicals under CA. In the rice-wheat systems of S. Asia, weeds are actually less in ZT wheat after rice because the weed seed is not exposed if the soil is not disturbed. This was one of the reasons farmers adopted ZT wheat. Interestingly, when a soil has increased microbial populations the soil has the ability to keep soil pathogens in check.","conservation agriculture, pest and weed problems",general questions,get insights,False
Why should one consider adopting CA if adequate yields and profits are being realized using conventional practices?,conservation agriculture,"Conventional agriculture is not sustainable. This is due to higher rates of soil erosion and loss of soil organic matter (SOM), which leads to increasing dependence on chemical fertilizers to make up for losses in soil fertility. Furthermore, the manufacture of chemical fertilizers and the operation of heavy machinery for tillage under conventional agriculture require high amounts of nonrenewable fossil fuels and release harmful greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the atmosphere. CA, by contrast, greatly reduces soil erosion and actually builds up soil organic matter reserves and soil fertility. Compared to conventional agriculture, CA uses fewer agrochemicals and greatly reduces fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Yet for many farmers currently practicing CA, the increased profits they earn under CA are most attractive. This is because agricultural yields are maintained or increased under CA while decreasing both chemical, fuel and labor inputs.","conservation agriculture, yields, profits",general questions,get insights,False

Isn't tillage necessary for increasing water infiltration and soil aeration?,conservation agriculture,"Although decades of research has shown that conventional tillage operations are beneficial for loosening compacted soils and improving water infiltration, the long-term effect of tillage operations is exactly the opposite, as bulk densities increase (plow pans) and water infiltration rates decline. Conservation agriculture, on the other hand, increases soil organic matter (SOM) content and decreases surface runoff and compaction by maintaining year-round vegetative cover and reducing the number of passes made over fields. Higher SOM content also increases biological activity in soils, and soil biota soon overtake tillage functions by increasing porosity and stabilizing soil structure. Thus, both infiltration and aeration are higher under CA, as compared to conventional agriculture.","tillage, water infiltration, soil aeration",general questions,get insights,False
Are chemical herbicides necessary in order to control cover crops before planting primary food crops under conservation agriculture?,conservation agriculture,"The answer to this question depends on whom you talk to. Some proponents of CA believe that using chemical herbicides such as glyphosate represents the most cost-effective and least environmentally intrusive method of controlling cover crops under NT. Yet this is simply not an option for many organic growers and others who favor reducing the application of agrochemicals. Thus, new technologies for controlling cover crops through the well-timed mowing, rolling or rolling/chopping of these crops prior to planting the main crop are being promoted as viable means of greatly reducing herbicide applications. In more temperate climates choosing a cover crop that is winter killed would be useful. There is also the tradeoff of using herbicides early on to get weeds under control and then easing off their use as the weeds are controlled by surface residues and other integrated weed management practices.","chemical herbicides, conservation agriculture",general questions,get insights,False

CA promotes the increase in surface soil microbes that will at first use nutrients in the residues and then release them to the plants later as they get recycled. However, since CA promotes growing leguminous cover crops, these systems usually experience a net gain in nitrogen since much of the nitrogen is ""fixed"" from the atmosphere rather than mined from the soil. Furthermore, phosphorus losses due to runoff is decreased under CA since the soil remains covered, infiltration is improved, erosion is decreased and soil organic matter is increased.

Can agroecology “feed” a growing global population?,agroecology,"A question often raised is whether agroecological farming can produce enough to nourish a growing population. Critics allege that a transition to agroecological practices will lead to lower yields. However, the current evidence base does not support this claim. Quite in contrast, comparative studies on different farming systems show that agroecological farming practices have the potential to sustainably increase yields1–3. Given the evidence, the controversy around the potential of agroecology to “feed” the world seems misguided.
For example, a meta-analysis on studies from a diverse set of countries found that on average, yields were 16% greater for agroecological practices as compared to conventional practices3. Similar effects have been found for conservation agricultural practices, which are often included in the definition of agroecology4. However, a distinction between short-term and long-term effects should be made. While the intensive use of synthetic fertilizers in conventional and industrial farming systems could achieve short-term yield gains, agroecological and conservation approaches aim to sustainably manage the natural resource base, which can result in higher yield gains over time5,6.
Furthermore, there is robust evidence that agroecology has a competitive edge from a nutrition perspective. Thanks to a diversity of crops and the integration of livestock, it can lead to a more balanced diet and increased availability of micronutrients7–13. Climate change and other disruptive factors further shift the balance in favour of agroecology, as agroecological systems are more resilient to external shocks and stresses14. Consequently, in order to ensure food and nutrition security for all, a shift in global dietary patterns and improved reduction of food waste and losses remains pivotal.","agroecology, global population",consumer questions,curious to know more,False
Is agroecology a promising approach for climate change mitigation or adaptation?,agroecology,"Food systems maintain a bidirectional relationship with climate change. On one side, the increase in global 
temperature, rainfall variation and the frequency as well as intensity of extreme weather events add 
pressure on food production and heavily affect food security. On the other side, industrial agriculture 
is one of the most significant sources of greenhouse gas emissions, and its intensification is likely to 
worsen global warming. Consequently, there is an urgent need to transform food production systems in 
order to ensure global food security without exacerbating climate change.
There is robust empirical evidence that agroecology based approaches can strengthen climate resilience 
of smallholder farmers and foster a low emissions pathway towards sustainable food systems. Three components play a key role in this regard: first, agroecology promotes the diversification of food 
production systems building on an integrated approach between agro-pastoralism, agroforestry and 
landscape farming. Through the availability of multiple livelihoods, diversification can buffer climate 
induced shocks for the farmers such as harvest loss from floods and droughts.
Second, agroecological practices can improve soil condition and fertility, for example by closing natural 
resource cycles and ensuring synergies between plants, forests and livestock. Among other benefits, 
healthy soils allow for retaining water during droughts and provide enough nutrients for reasonable 
harvests over a mid- to long-term period when climate change is expected to acerbate farming 
conditions.
Third, agroecology fosters locally adapted solutions by putting participation and context-specific 
knowledge at the centre27. Thus, actors of local food systems are more agile and flexible to adapt to their 
locally changing conditions and can swiftly replicate climate proofed knowledge through peer-to-peer 
networks.
There is also a broad range of indirect socio-economic benefits that result from selective, transformative 
agroecology elements (e.g. human values, circular economy or food traditions). See a non-exhaustive list 
here. However, further scientific evidence is needed to underpin this dimension.
Regarding climate change mitigation, healthy soils have an increased capacity to absorb and capture 
carbon dioxide from the atmosphere28. However, temporality of such sequestration needs to be secured. 
Additionally, agroecology practices reduce the need for pesticide and synthetic fertilizer use13, that cause 
significant emissions at their production and implementation stages (e.g. from NO2 leakage).","agroecology, climate change mitigation, adaptation",general questions,curious to know more,False
Is there a business case for agroecology?,agroecology,"Sceptics of agroecology often question the economic viability of agroecological practices. Despite this 
common critique, current evidence points to the contrary. Agroecological farming can in fact be 
economically viable and more profitable than conventional farming practices, as results of a meta-analysis 
show. Furthermore, agroecological practices can strengthen the resilience of agricultural businesses, 
fostering long-term, sustainable profitability. 

Empirical evidence on 
productivity and prices remains limited. However, a three-country study found that smallholder 
households practicing agroecology had higher productivities: 17% in Senegal, 32% in India, and between 
26% and 48% in Brazil30. These productivity benefits stem from a reduction of external input use, which 
outweigh increased labour costs. The same study also found that agroecology increased net-incomes by 
between 14% and 49% through higher sales prices.","agroecology, business",general questions,curious to know more,False

How long does a sheep or goat live?,sheep and goats,"Assuming good health (and good nutrition, and good teeth, and good luck), a sheep or goat 
female should be productive until she is about 10 years old. If teeth wear quickly, though, older 
animals will not be able to graze well enough to maintain condition, and then they are 
susceptible to illness and will not be able to raise kids or lambs very well.
Prime years for a sheep or goat female are typically ages 2 to 7. Rams and bucks sometimes 
have disposition problems as they age and may not be retained as breeders for long for that 
reason. Also, to avoid inbreeding, rams may need to be used for only two to three years on a 
given farm. ","sheep, goat, live",livestock keeping,curious to know more,False
How do I know how many animals my land can support?,sheep and goats,"One way to start answering this question is by asking your local Extension or NRCS agent how 
many acres it takes on your farm to support one cow. By looking at soil maps and forage types
and density, they can arrive at a good initial guess. Convert that number to sheep or goats by 
figuring five ewes equal one cow, and six or even seven goats equal one cow. Five dairy goats 
are approximately equivalent to the grazing pressure of a cow. Now, that gives you the upper 
limit; start with half that number initially and see how it goes. Always remember the impact of 
rainfall; in a good year, your land will seem relatively productive. If the rains don’t come the 
next year, you may suddenly realize that you are overstocked after all. Selling some stock 
quickly to protect the land, or buying hay if that is economically feasible, will usually turn out to 
be a smart move. See the Forages chapter in the Small Ruminant Resource Manual and the
Small Ruminant Sustainability Checksheet in the first chapter of that manual for more on this 
subject.","animals, land",livestock keeping,curious to know more,False
What breed is best to buy?,sheep and goats,"What do you plan to do? Here you need to think about your farm goals. Do you want to sell 
market lambs, or fine wool? Are you interested in conserving rare breeds, or in selling meat at 
the farmers market? For goats, is it meat or milk that is your focus? Some breeds are better 
suited to a purpose than others. Choosing a breed that is well-adapted for the purpose will 
result in greater profitability and less stress. 
Where do you live? Some breeds are well-adapted to a particular climate or region, and will 
not do well elsewhere. For example, Angora goats thrive in the dry areas of the United States, 
but may be very susceptible to parasites if moved to the humid South. Icelandic sheep are a 
great choice if you want to raise fiber in a cold climate, but heat stress may be a problem for 
them in the South. Consider the climate that will make the animals comfortable before 
choosing a breed.
What do other local producers raise? If no one else in your region is raising a particular breed, 
it may be because that breed does not thrive in your climate. It also might be true that a breed 
is just not well-known in your area, even though it is perfectly suited. In that case, you might fill 
a niche and create a demand by educating others about the breed. On the other hand, if no 
one else in your region is raising a breed, where will you need to go to purchase breeding 
stock? And who will buy the stock you raise? If you are raising Suffolk sheep and there are 
lots of 4-H members in your county who want market lambs to show, you have a ready market 
(assuming you have high quality, healthy stock). Those same 4-H members may not be 
interested in Jacob sheep. Someone who wanted to draw people to the farm and also sell to 
handspinners would be VERY interested in those Jacob sheep, and not the Suffolks! So consider 
local availability and demand, along with farm goals and your interest in marketing.
What are your criteria for animals on your farm? This is related to the idea of the breed 
meeting your goals, but takes it a little farther; let’s say I have decided my main focus is to raise 
lambs for meat. I will sell live lambs. And I want them to weigh 100 pounds in 120-150 days. A 
well-fed Suffolk might fit the bill; they are known for fast growth. On the other hand, let’s say I 
want animals that are parasite-resistant, hardy, and able to breed out of season. I also am 
interested in conserving a rare breed. Those criteria steer me away from the Suffolk, and 
toward the Gulf Coast Sheep; but now we have to prioritize, because they are NOT known for 
fast growth. 
How do you plan to raise and market the offspring? Again, this is an important factor in your 
decision. Using the comparison between Suffolk and Gulf Coast sheep, you might consider 
available feed and your personal values and decide that your farm is best-suited to raising 
sheep on pasture alone. The hardiness and parasite-resistance of the Gulf Coast then may 
make your decision easy. Suppose your customer is a restaurant that wants large lamb chops; 
the larger breed would be preferred (unless you convince the restaurant of how “cool” it is to 
conserve a rare breed and encourage genetic diversity!) An ethnic customer might be much 
5
happier with the smaller Gulf Coast lamb, available nearly year-round due to out-of-season 
breeding.
The question of which breed to buy is really impossible to answer without having all the 
background information. Then you must factor in personal preference; there is no sense in 
raising a breed you do not personally enjoy, no matter how many fine attributes it has. (For 
example, I will not raise Lamancha dairy goats because I do not like their ears.)
For many purposes, cross-bred animals will work better; they bring hybrid vigor and improved 
hardiness, as well as combining two sets of admirable traits. But the main thing to look for in 
breeding stock is not breed; it is health, local adaptation, and suitability for the market.

Manual give information about some breeds. Much more can be found in Storey’s Illustrated
Guide to Sheep, Goats, Cattle and Pigs, by Carol Ekarius.",breed,livestock keeping,curious to know more,False
Can we reconcile the need to intensify agricultural production system versus environmental sustainability?,crop damage prevention strategies,"Mechanization and resource use efficiency have significant effect on production, so there better management could lead to Environment friendly agriculture. Environmentally sustainable agricultural practices are now available, and it is essential that this information are widely disseminated and promoted. Feeding a growing and increasingly affluent population is clashing with efforts to conserve habitat and natural resources. Sustainable intensification, an effort to increase crop yields with fewer inputs and without expanding land use, seeks to balance these priorities. However, agriculture is focused on the working of soil and other facilities to produce crops, animals and trees for human consumption or further refinement into products, while industry is focused more on refining and processing raw materials into products for sale.",Agricultural production systems versus environment,crop cultivation,clear a doubt,False
Should I raise goats or sheep?,sheep and goats,"Several presentations in the PowerPoint Library address that very question. The answer
depends on:
Land base (Brushy land works better for goats; pasture works best for sheep.)
Market (What do your customers want?)
Personal preference
Economics (Look at expected profitability for each enterprise.)
Both goats and sheep require similar feeds, fencing, housing and facilities, and health care, 
including parasite management and predator control. Both produce meat that is desired by 
certain ethnic groups and by some health-conscious or environmentally aware consumers (and 
by some who just know that lamb and goat taste good). Market possibilities center on these 
groups. Both are generally inexpensive enterprises, and both sheep and goats are quick to 
mature and to be ready for breeding or market. Both usually will have twins. Both improve 
pastures by eating under-used forages and depositing manure.
But expect differences in profitability from sheep or goats if you are raising meat animals. 
Sheep gain more efficiently and are marketed at heavier weights than goats. This means that 
supplemental feed (if any) is used more effectively by sheep, and the selling price is higher, too. 
On the other hand, if clearing brush is your goal, goats excel at that task. So, in addition to the 
questions about land, market, personal preference, and economics—you really have to first 
identify farm goals. See the Small Ruminant Sustainability Checksheet for more about that 
important step.","goats, sheep",livestock keeping,get insights,False
"I would raise sheep, but I don’t think I can find a shearer.",sheep and goats,"Sheep shearing is a specialized skill, and it is hard work. Having a good shearer is important if 
you are selling to handspinners because they don’t want “second cuts” (little snibbly bits) in the 
fleece. And a careful shearer does not injure the animals, except for the occasional tiny nick, 
which heals easily. 
Because you want a good shearer, it’s a good idea to ask your network of sheep producer 
friends whom they use. It might be possible to pool your animals for shearing to save on set-up 
fees.","sheep, shearer",livestock keeping,get insights,False
Can I make money with wool?,sheep and goats,"Knitting and crocheting are popular now, and having natural fibers to sell to handspinners or

Sheep that produce good fleece that is also clean and free of “vegetable matter” 
(seeds, hay, leaves, etc.)
A niche market—which always takes extra time 
Some people value wool sheep for their natural fibers, prefer the looks and carcass 
characteristics of wooled sheep, and believe that they grow better. If the farmers put effort 
into marketing, wooled sheep provide another income stream. Lambskins, knitted or woven 
items, yarn, batts, raw fleece, stuffed animals, felt…for a talented craftsman, wool can 
significantly help profitability. See Paula Simmons’ Turning Wool into a Cottage Industry
(Storey Books) for more on this; also see Storey’s Guide to Raising Sheep (Paula Simmons and 
Carol Ekarius). Storey Publishing has also produced a wonderful book by Deborah Robson and 
Carol Ekarius, The Fleece & Fiber Sourcebook, which includes a wealth of information and 
gorgeous photos showing more than 200 animals and the uses of their fibers. Finally, 
magazines for fiber enthusiasts are a great place to advertise and to learn more about what the

 Can I make a lot of money with sheep or goats?,sheep and goats,"Sheep and goats are not get-rich-quick enterprises.
Having said that, historically there has been and there is continued potential for profit in sheep 
enterprises. Goats offer their own advantages in vegetation management and are growing in 
popularity (which usually improves prices). Let’s note some advantages of these enterprises.
Small size and low price for breeding stock = easy investment for a few starter animals
Animals quickly reach maturity and reproduce, and quickly reach slaughter size on 
forage alone = quick expansion of herd, quick payback of investment, low cost to 
produce a saleable animal for market or breeding
Multiple streams of income and easy combination with other enterprises, especially 
cattle = balanced risk and improved cash flow and profitability
Low investment in facilities and equipment = less debt and easier exit should you need 
to leave the enterprise
Enjoyable animals = personal satisfaction and family involvement
There are also significant disadvantages to sheep and goat enterprises. Here are a few.
Fencing must be better than a cattle fence; this takes money and work.
Predators are a consideration, and you must make provision to protect the stock; a good 
electric fence helps, but livestock guardian dogs (LGDs) are often needed as well. This 
means another animal to feed, provide health care, and manage; while most LGDs are 
good, some are not, and this can be a hassle.
Health care for sheep and goats can be demanding, especially internal parasite 
management. (Proper stocking rate and nutrition will help this, as well purchasing 
healthy stock to begin with.)
Because goats and sheep are small, income from selling market animals is low. This 
spreads risk and makes them easy to market, but it also means you need to sell a lot of 
animals to make significant income. You might be clearing $50 to $60 a head after 
paying expenses; if that is your sole income stream from the enterprise, you can see 
that it will be supplemental income for the farm, not enough to support a family unless 
numbers are large.
In some situations, supplemental feed will be needed. You must strike a balance here, 
providing good nutrition but keeping costs as low as possible.","money, sheep, goats",livestock keeping,get insights,False

This gives some time for illness to show up, and you can treat the new animals without

parasite infection, and check to be sure your dewormer was effective. If the new animals are 
carrying internal parasites that are resistant to your dewormer, you will need to use a different

Is ecological sustainable agriculture a solution for arable farmlands declining in the 21st century?,maize,"In connection with the warming up of the Earth's climate by the end of the 21st century, a significant part of the arable land will be either flooded by the seas and oceans or will be excluded from the production of crops due to intensifying drought. As part of the civilizational progress, including increasing the productivity of crop production per hectare, it will be necessary to continue research in this field. As part of the pro-ecological development of agriculture based on the assumptions of sustainable pro-ecological development, ie the concept of green economy, chemistry should be gradually reduced to reduce environmental pollution and reduce the impact of chemicals on human health and other life forms. In this way, the adverse impact of civilizational imbalances in natural ecosystems will be limited. In connection with the above, the aim of continuing increasing the production efficiency of agricultural crops per hectare in the future will be intensified by mechanization automation, robotization, improvement of weather forecasting and logistics systems for field works, and improvement of current crop varieties by increasing their resistance to viral and bacterial diseases, fungal, parasitic etc. An important field of research and scientific discipline, thanks to which it is possible to gradually improve current crop varieties by increasing their resistance to diseases is genetics. In addition, it is necessary to improve irrigation and greenhouse systems due to the progressive global warming and more and more often natural cataclysms. It is also important to improve the techniques of recycling and re-use of waste from intensified agricultural production, so that those wastes that are unsuitable for re-use were as few as possible. It is also important to limit the wastage of produced crops, reduce and develop the recycling of organic waste from the food production process in the agri-food processing sector. As part of the development of sustainable agriculture, it is also important to develop organic farming referring to natural ecosystems. This type of agriculture refers to natural ecosystems in which primary varieties of arable crops function or function. As part of this concept of ecological agriculture, different agricultural crops grow on one agricultural area, which also limits the potential scale of pest feeding and feeding, and ensures a better economy of savings in the use of plant protection products. Therefore, the use of genetics should be limited only to the successive improvement of current varieties of agricultural produce by increasing their resistance to viral, bacterial, fungal, parasitic diseases, and not to create completely new species of flora and fauna. In this way, through the process of improving, increasing resistance to diseases of agricultural crops, genetics would help to restore or at least significantly increase the natural balance in intensified agriculture. For this process to work it is necessary to develop also the above-mentioned other techniques of environmentally-friendly sustainable development of agriculture. All of the above-mentioned techniques must be applied in a purposefully, precisely planned integrated system of managing sustainable and environmentally friendly agriculture.

Do farmers waste water?,sustainability trends in agriculture,"Water is necessary to grow plants that provide food, fiber and shelter for the world. Agriculture production in
the U.S. accounts for approximately 80% of the nation’s “consumptive water use.”i “Consumptive water use” is
the term that describes water used and not returned to the original source. However, when we use water in
our home, or when an industry like agriculture uses water, about 90 percent of the water used is eventually
returned to the environment where it replenishes water sources and can be used for other purposes. But of the
water used for irrigation, only about one‐half is reusable. The rest is lost by evaporation into the air,
evapotranspiration from plants, or is lost in transit.ii While agriculture requires significant water to grow crops
and raise animals, unused water returns to the ecosystem. Farmers are focused on conserving water for several
reasons: 1) Farmers know water wasted could mean a lack of the resource for future crops. 2) Water is
expensive. Water wasted is money lost. 3) Farmers are cultivators. They use precise technology to know exactly
how much water a plant needs to grow. Too much could mean poor production. 4) Many farmers rely on
Mother Nature for water.","water, waste",general questions,get insights,False
Do farmers use more pesticides and fertilizers when they use GM (genetically modified) seeds?,sustainability trends in agriculture,"Using GM seeds that are selected for the right environment can actually decrease the amount of pesticides a
farmer must use. Let’s take a look at what’s going on in the industry today. One of the most common GM
varieties is called Bt seed — it allows a crop to release a protein from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)
that acts as a natural pesticide to certain insects. Use of pesticides with Bt crops has drastically decreased.
Another common GM variety enables a plant to resist the herbicide glyphosate. For example, Roundup® is a
common glyphosate product. Roundup® Ready Corn, a GM product, can still grow when Roundup® is applied.
For these crops, herbicide use has increased because farmers can apply the herbicide on all of their land.
glyphosate, however, is one of the mildest herbicides. It has toxicity 25 times less than caffeine. The ability to
use glyphosate more frequently has enabled farmers to decrease use of more toxic herbicides. In the last 20
years, the use of GM seeds has reduced pesticide spraying by 8.1%. Because of this, the environmental impact
associated with pesticide use on biotech crops has decreased by more than 18%.iv Learn more with the Food

Why are farmers markets popular?,local farmers markets,"Growers, consumers and communities are all recognizing the benefits of farmers markets.

For growers, farmers markets provide an opportunity to sell products at retail prices. This allows growers to gain greater control over production and marketing decisions and also provides growers with opportunities to sell specialty or niche products, products that are limited in quantity, or products of varying quality, such as slightly blemished canning tomatoes. Because the vendor fees charged by markets are much lower than the cost of establishing an off-farm retail outlet, farmers markets enable growers to test new enterprises or give direct marketing a try without making a huge financial investment.

For consumers and communities, farmers markets offer a host of social, economic and health benefits. Farmers markets provide a great place to meet and socialize with neighbors and offer an alternative shopping experience. They draw people out of their homes, help improve neighborhoods, and provide an economic stimulus to neighborhoods and downtown districts.

Should our market be producer-only or allow products grown by others?,local farmers markets,"One of the most fundamental issues addressed in any set of rules is whether to allow the sale of products that are produced by someone other than the vendor. Some groups elect to create a producer-only market and allow vendors to sell only products grown on their farms. Others elect to allow for varying quantities of products to be resold at the market. Each option has advantages and disadvantages. For example, producer-only markets capitalize on the increasing interest in local food and are able to cater to customers who place a high value on supporting and getting to know the local growers in their community. Conversely, markets that allow growers and vendors to resell varying amounts of products grown by other growers will often have a wider variety of in-season and out-of-season products and may appeal to customers looking for convenience. In either case, enforcing the rules may require farm visits by the market manager or board of directors to ensure compliance.

Baked goods, Eric Reuter photFigure 3. Market rules guide what kinds of products can be sold at a farmers market and whether vendors must produce the items sold.

Yet another issue addressed in the market’s rules is whether to allow the sale of nonfood items, such as crafts. If your market intends to allow the sale of crafts, consider creating rules to specify which items may be sold and what percentage of the total number of vendors may sell crafts. Farmers markets sometimes allow vendors to sell crafts to develop a more diverse vendor base and cater to certain customers. Some markets require that craft items be made from materials raised or collected on the vendor’s own farm.

Regardless of which options you choose, it is important to create a market that is not only consistent with the stated purpose of the market but that also meets your customers’ demands. It is also important to weigh your options carefully, survey potential customers about their preferences, and consult with market organizers, managers and growers who have experience with many types of markets.","market, products",market related,get insights,False

"The crop productivity is influenced by several factors like temperature, solar radiation, water and carbon dioxide concentration and it is accepted fact that scattered aerosols play key role in change of temperature and thereby affecting the crop yield. The type of aerosols decides the trend of temperature change and crop productivity. For example, the bright colored aerosols cause reflection of sun light in all directions and back towards space and result in cooling. However, the dark colored aerosols absorb the radiation and warms the atmosphere. One main negative effect of aerosols is in the form of hastening the process of melting of ice.",sustainability trends in agriculture,"COVID 19 has no direct impact on the crops, but it diverge concentration of farmers towrds its care due to low income and fear.

Is there any direct role of soil color on crop production?,soil conditions,"Soil color is mainly the concern of the parent materials by which soil is being formed as well as rocks which after metamorphism develop into different colors...
Color of the soil is also developed by the minerals present and by the organic matter content. It is said that soil having oxidized form of iron that is ferric ions Fe++ will developed in to yellow or red color..
 Dark brown or black color of the soil is produced by the minerals present and by the organic matter content.
Wet soil or water clogged soils will appear in darker color than dry soil.
Presence of the moisture of water also affects soil color as it influence redox potential that is oxidation and reduction of mineral compounds which results in color variations...
In well drained soil or aerobic ecosystem of soils due to presence of oxygen and better diffusion of it, red color develop due to the oxidation of irons while under water logging conditions or extremely wet soil (with low oxygen) there will be grey or green color by the presence of reduced (ferrous) iron oxide.
If the soil is white in color, it means there is remarkable amount of calcite especially in arid regions where more evaporation hence leaving the salts above the soil surface developing white in color...
Organic matter or humus make the soil color more darker especially black or brown... it is said that red color soils having good drainage as it is developed through oxidized iron compounds having aerobic ecosystem...
Dark color soils absorbs more solar radiation and warm quickly as compared to the lighter in color...
Actually soil color tells about its origin, constitution as well as nature of parent materials...it some how can affects crop production also.....",role of soil color,crop cultivation,know what,True

How far can we depend on simulation models in predicting impacts of climate changes on crop production?,agricultural technologies,"Many of us have used or read about simulation models that predict impacts of climate changes on crop production. The bases of these models are the results of experiments that were carried out in closed systems (very artificial growth conditions) and/or more recently FACE (Free Air CO2 Enrichment) experiments which is more close to natural system. However, even with FACE experiments which focus more on CO2 elevation, there is still the effect of higher wind speed in this experiment that may increase water loss by the plant and/or the air temperature that may not represent the natural conditions. This results somehow on overestimation of some plant parameters and underestimation of others.","simulation models , predicting climate",crop cultivation,know how,False

What are the harmful effects of fertilizer application on crops utilization?,"manure, fertilizers and soil nutrients","Fertilizers - mineral ""chemical"" and organic fertilisers as well (!) can pollute the environment only when used in amounts not adapted to the real crop nutrient demand (as a function of expected yield) and the availability in the soil according to precedent soil analysis. Particularly the overuse of N and P will produce eutrophication of waters and N might produce leaching problems to the groundwater as well as air pollution by the emission of nitrous oxide (N2O) contributing to the greenhouse effect. Such negative effects are not specific for chemical fertilisers but for organic as well. Livestock wastes or manure may contribute to soil pollution much more than chemical fertilisers. Before discussing prejudiced the negative effects of chemical fertilisers, you should always take in mind that at least 50% of crop yield is attributable to this kind of fertiliser nutrient inputs ! Chemical fertilisers aren't negative - it is their inefficient and not demand-oriented use by unprofessional or ill- advised farmers.",effects of fertilizer application,crop cultivation,know what,False
How to improve cotton productivity in India,cotton,"The cotton productivity in India is declining after 2007. The reasons assigned were spread of Bt hybrid cotton from 65% to 98% area to marginal lands and rainfall aberrations. Basically the area expanded was at the cost of groundnut, soybean, maize, sorghum which farmers felt less economical than Bt hybrid cotton in shallow and marginal soils. Non practice of crop rotation is stagnating the p[roductivity in the last 10 years.Cotton is indeed one of the most important crops of Indian subcontinent. But during the last few years, we are experiencing a certain fall in the cotton productivity here. Actually the GM cotton or Bt cotton was introduced in India to enhance the cotton productivity but, with the passage of time, an unexpected as well as unacceptable outcome was viewed...the productivity started to fall.
The major reason behind this is the violation of the principles of agro-ecology significantly which eventually suggests the extreme mono-culture of a certain crop species. To improve productivity of wheat presently, we have to focus on the absolute abandonment of Bt cotton and start the farming by maintaining the principles of agro-ecology with support of organic agriculture.
