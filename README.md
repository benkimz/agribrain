Small-scale farmers face challenges in accessing quality information and markets for their produce, resulting in low productivity, poor yields, and limited income. Additionally, food insecurity is a prevalent issue in many regions around the world. The AgriBrain project aims to address these challenges by providing farmers with an AI-powered search portal that offers weather forecasting models and quality advice on farming practices, bringing farmers together in clusters to access a common market for their produce, and providing a charity program to help solve the hunger crisis.
